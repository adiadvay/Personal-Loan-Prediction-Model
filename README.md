# Predictive Model for Bank Personal Loan Campaign 
This project aims to help Thera Bank, a US bank, identify which of its existing liability (depositor) customers have a high probability of accepting a personal loan. Following a previous campaign with a 9% success rate, the bank's marketing department seeks to improve conversion rates through more effective, targeted marketing. This model analyzes customer data to predict loan acceptance, enabling the bank to focus its marketing efforts on the most promising leads.
